#📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes Esporte Clube Vitória’s performance in the 2023 Brasileirão Série B, focusing on match results, points accumulation, and home vs away performance.
The objective is to identify the key factors that contributed to the team’s title-winning campaign using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization.

The analysis combines Python for data cleaning and exploration with Tableau for interactive dashboards and storytelling.


#🎯 Objectives

*Analyze points progression throughout the season

*Compare performance home vs away

*Evaluate goal-scoring and defensive consistency

*Identify patterns related to clean sheets, averages, and match outcomes

*Transform raw match data into actionable insights

#🛠️ Tools & Technologies

*Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – data cleaning and EDA

*Google Colab – analysis environment

*Tableau – interactive dashboards and KPIs

*GitHub – version control and project documentation

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains match-level information from 38 rounds of the 2023 Série B season, including:

*Round

*Venue (Home / Away)

*Match Result (Win / Draw / Loss)

*Goals For (GF) and Goals Against (GA)

*Goal Difference (GD)

*Possession

*Attendance

*Formation

*Captain

*Referee

#🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase focused on:

*Data type corrections and missing values handling

*Feature engineering (Total Points, Goal Difference, Points per Round)

*Home vs Away performance breakdown

*Descriptive statistics and trend analysis

This step ensured data consistency before visualization.

#📈 Dashboards & Visualizations

Three main dashboards were created in Tableau:

*Season Performance Overview

**Points accumulation per round

**Match result distribution

**Home vs Away win ratio

*Goals Analysis

**Goals scored and conceded (Home vs Away)

**Average goals per match

**Clean sheets comparison

*Key Takeaways & Summary

**Consolidated insights highlighting consistency, home dominance, and balanced away performance

**Each dashboard includes contextual explanations to support data-driven storytelling.

#💡 Key Insights

*Vitória showed remarkable consistency throughout the season

*Home performance was decisive, with high win percentage and strong defensive solidity

*Away results were balanced and competitive, contributing significantly to points accumulation

*Defensive strength, especially at home, was a key factor in securing the title

#✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how combining EDA, KPI design, and interactive dashboards can uncover meaningful insights in sports analytics.
It highlights Vitória’s championship campaign as a case study of consistency, defensive efficiency, and effective use of home advantage.
